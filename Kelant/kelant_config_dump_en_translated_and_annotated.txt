; --------- IMPORTANT NOTES --------- 
;
; - This file can be used as is to restore the settings on a KELANT or one can create a new txt file and copy commands as needed
; - Commands can also be commented out by preceding them with a  ;  (lines that start with  ;  are ignored by the machine)
; - To apply changes on a machine, print this or your own txt file on the machine
;
; M8513 erases the eeprom meaning any stored z level offsets are deleted and one needs to set the plate zero again 
; M8500 commits the file commands to the EEPROM, if this is omited on the file the changes will revert on power cycle

M8016 I6			; Z second zero return speed
M8015 T2			; Z slow rising speed
M8016 T6			; Z fast rising and falling speed
M8016 D0			; The number of milliseconds to wait after Z rises
M8030 T-1			; Fan 2 control, 1: Follow exposure 0: Normally closed -1: Normally open
M8030 S4			; LED control, 1: Normally open 0: normally closed 2: Follow the model printing
